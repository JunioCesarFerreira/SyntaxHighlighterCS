### Description
This project is a text editor application with syntax highlighting, built using C# and Windows Forms. It supports syntax highlighting for the following languages: JSON, XML, SQL, C++. The highlighter dynamically adjusts the text color in a RichTextBox based on the selected language, improving readability and editing experience.

### Features
- **Multiple Language Support**: Highlights syntax for JSON, XML, SQL, C++, and potentially more, based on system configuration.
- **Dynamic Highlighting**: Automatically updates the highlighting as the text changes.
- **File Interaction**: Opens and saves files directly through the interface, facilitating instant editing and viewing of files.

### Prerequisites
